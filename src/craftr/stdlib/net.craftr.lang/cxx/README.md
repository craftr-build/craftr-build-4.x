### Module: `craftr/lang/cxx`

This module allows you to compile C & C++ libraries and applications with
Craftr without having to care much about the host platform and compiler
toolset.

#### Supported Compilers

* MSVC
* MinGW
* GCC
* Clang

#### To do

* The module was copied from Craftr 3 and is not yet fully adapted to the
  Craftr 4 API. Currently confirmed working is the MSVC toolset.
* Lots of other stuff that I should add her -- for now, see the code
